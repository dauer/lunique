lunique
=======
Lua library for generating universally unique identifiers using libuuid.
lunique probably only works on Linux operating systems (testet using Ubuntu)...

lunique is very early in development, expect errors etc.

Requirements
------------
* lua 5.1+
* uuid-dev

Documentation
-------------
Build the library using the Makefile in the ./src folder.

Then have a look at the 'example.lua' file to see how to use the library.

Todo
----
* Implement more functions from the UUID library
* Do thorough testing (unittests...)
* Write better documentation
