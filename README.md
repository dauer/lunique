lunique
=======
Lua library for generating universally unique identifiers using libuuid.
lunique probably only works on Linux operating systems (testet using Ubuntu)...

lunique is very early in development so expect errors etc.

Requirements
------------
* lua 5.1+
* uuid-dev

Documentation
-------------
Build the library using the Makefile in the ./src folder.

Then have a look at the 'example.lua' file to see how to use the library.

Todo
----
* Do thorough Testing...
* Write better documentation
